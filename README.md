# simple-distributed-storage
This is first project of Computer Network Course at the University of Tehran.

We implemented a distributed storage network using python.

We have network using mininet. Each host role plays as one terminal. One host send data to hosts on network and when it wants to retrieve, it sends a message and get back file.
